This project explores the relationship between land use changes and temperature variations over time, focusing on key agricultural countries. The goal is to analyze how global warming may have impacted agricultural land distribution, particularly grazing land and cropland, from 2000 to 2023.

Data Sources: Kaggle
=> Weather Data (1940-2023): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samithsachidanandan/average-monthly-surface-temperature-1940-2024

=> Land Use Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/agriculture-is-a-major

The analysis is focused on six major agricultural countries:
                          ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ United States, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ India, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China, ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º Russia, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazil, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º Australia.


This project showcases my Excel data analysis skills, including data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization techniques.

Data Cleaning & processing
- Formatted the data by removing duplicates, filtering rows, and selecting relevant columns.
- Corrected inconsistencies in country and year mappings.
- Used XLOOKUP to match yearly average temperatures with land use data.

Analysis & Insights
- I created pivot tables for grazing land, crops, and temperature to analyze trends.
- Observed that Grazing Land has been decreasing over the years, while Cropland has been increasing.
- Noticed a gradual increase in global temperatures over the timeframe.

Visualizations & Dashboard
- Heat Maps: To highlight temperature changes and grazing land evolution over time.
- Line Charts: To show trends in temperature, grazing land, and cropland over the years.
